# WikiSearch
Based on DrEinsteinium's tWiki mod, WikiSearch is a tModLoader mod that allows you to search the [Terraria Wiki](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/) for whatever is under the mouse cursor.

Press Q to search the wiki while hovering over any item, NPC, or tile.

## Known Issues
* Some naturally-placed tiles cannot be searched
* Chests open the chest page instead of the individual page
